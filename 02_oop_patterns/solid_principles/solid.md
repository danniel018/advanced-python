## **S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.

## **O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. You should be able to add new functionality without changing existing code.

## **L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without breaking the application. Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.

## **I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use. It's better to have many specific interfaces than one general-purpose interface.

## **D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (interfaces). Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.
